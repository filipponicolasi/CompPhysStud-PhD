# Scientific Computing for Physics - task01-docker

This project is part of the *Scientific Computing for Physics* PhD course. It provides a step-by-step guide on how to install **Docker** on the Windows operating system and how to create and run an **AlmaLinux 9** container using Docker.  

## Project Structure  

The project is divided into several guides and code files.

### Installation Guides
1. **Docker_Windows_Installation.md** – Guide to installing Docker on Windows.  
2. **AlmaLinux9_Container.md** – Instructions for creating and running an AlmaLinux 9 container using Docker.  
3. **Python_installation.md** – Guide to installing Python on AlmaLinux 9.  
4. **C_installation.md** – Guide to installing C on AlmaLinux 9.  

### Programming Tasks
This project also includes simple programs written in both **Python** and **C** that compute the scalar product:

```
Z = a * x + y
```
where:
- `a = 3` (scalar value)  
- `x = (1,1,...,1)` (vector of size 20)  
- `y = (4,4,...,4)` (vector of size 20)  

### Source Code Files
- **program.c** – C implementation of the scalar product calculation.  
- **program.py** – Python implementation of the scalar product calculation.  

Both programs write the computed values of `Z` to an output file named `output.txt`.
