# Scientific Computing for Physics - task01-docker

This project is part of the *Scientific Computing for Physics* PhD course. It provides a step-by-step guide on how to install **Docker** on the Windows operating system and how to create and run an **AlmaLinux 9** container using Docker.  

## Project Structure  

The project is divided into two main files:  

1. **Docker_Windows_Installation.md** – A guide to installing Docker on Windows.  
2. **AlmaLinux9_Container.md** – Instructions on creating and running an AlmaLinux 9 container using Docker.  

These files contain all necessary steps, from installation to running a Linux environment inside Windows.
